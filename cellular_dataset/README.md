## The Cellular dataset
The original plan of this master's project was to analyse the Cellular dataset: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-02687-x

The first weeks of the project was spent on looking at the Cellular dataset, and the notebooks in this folder contain some of the work that was performed. However, upon discussions with the autophagy team at UiO, the focus was changed to in-vivo images instead, since this comprised a new and potentially more promissing experimental set-up.
