## The Cellular dataset
The original plan of this master's project was to analyse the Cellular dataset: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-02687-x

The first weeks of the project was spent on looking at the Cellular dataset. However, following discussions with the autophagy team at UiO, the project's focus shifted to in-vivo images, as this new direction presented a potentially more promising experimental setup. The notebooks in this folder document some of the work that was performed before changing dataset.
