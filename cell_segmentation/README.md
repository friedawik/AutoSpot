### Cell segmentation
Individual cell segmentation was performed using the graphical user interface (GUI) of the Cellpose tool. Stained cell border images were utilised to train a segmentation model, which was subsequently applied to the images in our dataset. Both types of images contained the DAPI channel, along with either mCherry-tagged Atg8 (from our dataset) or GFP-tagged Atg8 (from the images used in the ground truth set). This overlap allowed the trained model to be used on our data.

The segmentation process was only evaluated through visual inspection. The aim was to isolating enough cells for subsequent spot analysis. The process is described in the notebook.
