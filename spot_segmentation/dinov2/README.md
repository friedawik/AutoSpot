## DINOv2 for Spot Segmentation
This project uses the DINOv2 model from Hugging Face to segment spots in fluorescence microscopy images.
### Description
The codes perform spot segmentation in fluorescence microscopy images using the DINOv2 (Vision Transformer) model. We use the pre-trained model from Hugging Face to adapt it for our specific use case of spot segmentation in microscopy images.

### Model details
We use the DINOv2 model from Hugging Face, specifically the facebook/dinov2-base variant. The model is fine-tuned on a dataset of fluorescence microscopy images to adapt it for spot segmentation.
